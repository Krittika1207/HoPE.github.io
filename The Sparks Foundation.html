    The Sparks Foundation. This brand new education nonprofit trying to sell students hope for successful future. Hope that they can rise out of any situation, regardless of where they came from. Whether it’s from a family with a less than ideal financial situation or a family that simply does not support where they want to go. Either way, The Sparks Foundation (or TSF) is for you. This brand new startup was co-founded by people who believe that every student should have a chance at greatness, and they have created multiple programs to help students reach their maximum potential.<br>
    The first program that they have successfully put into play for about three months now is their Graduate Rotational Internship Program, or GRIP. This internship program is based completely online as a part-time internship for students to complete in the span of 3 months. GRIP offers internships for the areas of tech, marketing, and human resources. The first month works on individual tasks, such as writing articles and designing posters, the second month consists of group work. The groups for the second month of the program are based on a personality test that all interns take at the beginning of the program so that all interns are placed into groups that will complement their strengths and weaknesses. The last month focuses on expanding the interns’ knowledge of the area they are working in. This program has been successfully running for a few months now, and TSF is expanding their programs to include a wider variety of students from a variety of different backgrounds.<br>
    One-on-one mentorship is the most effective strategy for aiding a student to achieve their maximum potential. TSF aims to match mentors that are experts in their field to students who want to enter the field. In their words, they want to, “Help them [the students] shape their dreams into reality.” They aim to match personalities and careers that will work well together so that the student can achieve the maximum amount of success when they enter their future field. The mentor is paired up with their mentee and receives scheduled routine progress monitoring so that they do not fall behind. By receiving direct attention, mentors are able to directly see their mentees strengths and weaknesses and work on them accordingly. This is the fastest and most effective way to teach students how to succeed both with their hard and soft skills. By working one-on-one, they are able to develop problem-solving skills and a deeper understanding of their field at a much more rapid pace.<br>
    These are just some of the programs that The Sparks Foundation are offering to all students. As TSF grows, they have a vision for an even wider array of programs to help an even broader spectrum of students. These programs are only the beginning of visionaries that aim to improve the future of all students, and students are our future. TSF aspires to give hope to improve the lives of our future to improve everyone’s future.
